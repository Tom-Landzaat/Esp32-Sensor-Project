# Esp32-Sensor-Project UNDER CONSTRUCTION
For my ENGR 103 Final Project I wanted to determine if there was a relationship between temperature and soil moisture. My hypothesis was soil moisture will decrease as temperature increases due to more evaporation. For my project I used a resistive hygrometer which has two legs, one which sends out low voltage and the other leg reads the voltage coming in. From this you can calculate the resistance of the soil, lower if it is more wet and higher if it is dry. For my temperature sensor I used a digital thermometer (LM75a) which has precision within 2 Â°C. In addition I hooked up a pixel by pixel display to display the current readings and the duration of data collection.
